<b> Video #1: </b>

Learning Objective:
* IOC-1.A – Explain how an effect of a computing innovation can be both beneficial and harmful.

Essential Knowledge:
* IOC-1.A.1 – People create computing innovations.
* IOC-1.A.2 – The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations.
* IOC-1.A.3 – Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance.
* IOC-1.A.4 – A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people or even by the same person. 
* IOC-1.A.5 – Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts.

Beneficial and Harmful Effects:
* Multirotor:
  * Benefit - Deliveries, finding lost people, and aerial photography is easy.
  * Harmful - Flying in unregulated zones is illegal and dangerous; privacy concerns.
* Wii Controller:
  * Benefit - Gets people active while playing video games.
  * Harmful - Broken TV's as well as injuries.
* Dopamine is what allows us to feel pleasure and happiness. It is produce when we engage in activities that allow us to feel enjoyed, interested, passionate, and happy.

Learning Objective:
* IOC-1.B – Explain how a computing innovation can have an impact beyond its intended purpose.

Essential Knowledge:
* IOC-1.B.1 – Computer innovations can be used in ways that their creators had not originally intended: 
  * The World Wide Web was originally intended only for rapid and easy exchange of information within the scientific community. However, it its users now include a large portion of the general population.
  * Targeted advertising is used to help businesses, but it can be misued at both individual and aggregate levels.
  * Machine learning and data mining have enabled innovation in medicine, business, and science, but information  discovered in this way has also been used to discriminate against groups of individuals.
* IOC-1.B.2 – Some of the ways computing innovations can be used may have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or culture.
* IOC-1.B.3 – Responsible programmers try to consider the unintended ways their computing innovations can be used and the potential beneficial and harmful effects of these new uses.
* IOC-1.B.4 – It is not possible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be used.
* IOC-1.B.6 – Rapid sharing of a pogram or running a program with a large number of users can result in significant impacts beyond the intended purpose or control of the programmer.

Beneficial and Harmful Effects:
* Microtransactions:
  * "Free" Games/Apps.
  * Cosmetics/Pay-To-Win/Paywall to functionality.
* The Internet – Originally Intended For Scientists:
  * Sleep deprivation, depression, anxiety, and impulsivity.
  * Dopamine feedback loops.
