 4. Add two items below to get ready for animations and interacting with terminal codes 
 
* Key Learning Code Snippets:

import swap
import christmastree
import keypad
import badboat
import goodboat


main_menu = [
    ["Swap", swap.run],
    ["Keypad", keypad.run],
]

drawingsub_menu = [
    ["Christmas Tree", christmastree.options]
]

animationsub_menu = [
    ["Bad Boat", badboat.run],
    ["Good Boat", goodboat.ship]
]

border = "=" * 25
banner = f"\n{border}\nPlease Select An Option\n{border}"


def buildMenu(banner, options):
    print(banner)
    prompts = {0: ["Exit", None]}
    for op in options:
        index = len(prompts)
        prompts[index] = op
    for key, value in prompts.items():
        print(key, '->', value[0])
    choice = input("Type your choice> ")
    try:
        choice = int(choice)
        if choice == 0:
            return
        try:
            action = prompts.get(choice)[1]
            action()
        except TypeError:
            try:
                exec(open(action).read())
            except FileNotFoundError:
                print(f"File not found!: {action}")
    except ValueError:
        print(f"Not a number: {choice}")
    except UnboundLocalError:
        print(f"Invalid Choice: {choice}")
    buildMenu(banner, options)
