# Create Task Project #
## Project Description: ##
**Achievement Progression Journey.** For this year's College Board Create Task Project, I am planning on progamming an application that helps students, particularly high school students, with planning out their school life and managing their time in order to have effective and useful learning, as well as to become successful students.

* #### Program Purpose: Create an application that helps students manage their time by assiting them in having adequete and sustainable productivity.
* #### Input: The user can create a to-do list, in which they can list out their activities within time frams as well as by levels of priority and importance. 
* #### Lists: The to-do list elements will be stored in organized, ordered, and displayed sequences, and will be available for view to the users.
* #### Procedure: When a user logs on to the Achievement Progression Journey, they will be able start planning their goals for school as well as for their future(e.g. Universities and Colleges, Career, Etc.). They will also have the ability to create daily to-do lists, in which they can organize their tasks, jobs, and events into specific times, as well as be able to assign rankings to the elements of their to-do lists and sort them in order of priority.
* #### Parameters: The inputs of users will be displayed on the Achievement Progression Journey website, and the presented items will be sorted by the preference of users.
* #### Iteration: Users are able to repeatedly add elements to their to-do lists and goals planner. Users can also choose to create daily tasks,which will continuously reappear on their designated to-do lists once a new day starts.
* #### Output: After creating their to-do list(s) and outlines for their goals and aspirations, users will be to view all of the elements that they had made with ease, since there will be labels that will help them navigate through the website to view their to-do lists and plans for their dreams.
* #### Sequencing: Sequencing will be primarily be shown in the Python code and CRUD programming system.
