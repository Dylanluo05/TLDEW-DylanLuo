### College Board Topic 5.3 Computing Bias: ###

#### Video #1: ####

Learning Objective:
* IOC-1.D – Explain how bias exists in computing innovations.

Essential Knowledge:
* IOC-1.D.1 – Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation. 
* IOC-1.D.2 – Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases.
* IOC-1.D.3 – Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development.

Computing Bias:
* Netflix:
  * Explicit Data:
    * Thumbs.
    * Name, address, etc.
  * Implicit Data:
    * When you watch.
    * What you binge(d).
    * Style of shows frequently selected.
  * Bias:
    * Netflix exclusives are featured ahead of most other shows.
    * Subscriptions.
* Hypothetical Loan Company:
  * Creating software to assist loan officers.
  * Find trends in successful loans.
  * Reject those who do not fit their trends:
    * Age.
    * Gender.
    * Race/Ethnicity.
* All software can be biased (Unintentional/Intentional):
  * Casual Vs Sweaty.
  * YouTube Kids.
  * Facebook vs Instagram vs Snapchat/TikTok.
  * WeChat/KakaoTalk.
  * Amazon Echo/Google Home.
* Questions to ask about bias:
  * Enhancing or intentionally excluding?
  * Intentionally harmful/hateful?
  * Receiving feedback from a wide variety of people?

GitHub Pages Actions. Break out into Study Groups of 2 or 3:
1. Watch the video: HP computers are racist.
   * Done.
2. Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. 
   * Summary and thoughts on the video – HP computers are racist: I believe that the Computing Bias is not intentional. I do not think HP as a company would dare to make an intentional Computing Bias like this, as discrimination against a certain racial group would spark outrage in the public. This is a harmful Computing Bias because the facial camera of the computer is unable to detect the faces and bodies of people that have a darker skin color, however, it most likely is not intentional. A possibility as to why this happens is that the HP computer cameras do not work very in identifying darker skin. In my opinion, this should be corrected, and one way HP can fix this is by improving its HP computer cameras so that they can detect people of darker skin colors.

### College Board Topic 5.4 Crowdsourcing: ###

#### Video #1: ####

Learning Objective:
* IOC-1.E – Explain how people participate in problem-solving processes at scale.

Essential Knowledge:
* IOC-1.E.1 – Widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results.
* IOC-1.E.2 – Science has been affected by using distributed and "citizen science" to solve scientific problems.
* IOC-1.E.3 – Citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices.
* IOC-1.E.4 – Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the Internet.
* IOC-1.E.5 – Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing.
* IOC-1.E.6 – Crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding.

Crowdsourcing:
* Increasing crowdsourcing allows for more reach beyond the community, and as a result will reduce Computer Bias.
* Crowdsourcing enables the ability to attain shared information, share information, and participate in distributed computing.
* Obtaining Data Via Crowdsourcing:
  * Crowdsourcing collects external data through APIs. A prominent API is RapidAPI. The data we attain through Crowdsourcing influence the way we code and show possibilities in attaining and analyzing data.
  * GitHub is another great example of code Crowdsourcing. Many of us coders have forked from repositories and exchanged code with peer programmers. Crowdsourcing on GitHub allows us to analyze GitHub code, as well as attain profiles and information of a person's coding history
* Public Data Sets:
  * Kaggle:
    * Courses in visualizations, TensorFlow, AI, machine learning, and more.
    * Competitions – Cash prizes, swag, props, etc.
    * Notebooks – Code, data, notes, etc.
  * Google Public Datasets:
    * Free for the 1st terabyte.
    * All-in-one package that uses BigQuery – Library and toolset for SQL.
  * Data.gov:
    * United States of America Government data.
    * Agriculture, energy, water, health, and more.
  * Your local government:
    * Keeps them accountable.
    * Help find solutions and trends in your area.
* Distributed Computing:
  * Donates spare computing power in order to help calculations.
    * Examples: Protein folding, mathematics, climate, astrophysics, etc.
* Crowdsourcing Innovations:
  * Spotify:
    * Collaborative Playlists.
    * Algorithms.
    * Metadata write-in.
  * Crowdfunding:
    * Kickstarter.
    * IndieGoGo.
    * Etc.
  * Blockchain:
    * Cryptocurrency.
    * Other tokens - Concert tickets.

GitHub Pages Actions:
1. CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
   * An idea that I have that involves Crowdsourcing is an application that enables Computer Science Principles students the ability to access a website where they can participate in collaborative programming. A plan that I have is that the application will essentially be like Google Drive, where users can edit a program of code at the same time and be able to view the live changes.
2. What about Del Norte Crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with Crowdsourcing?
   * The Computer Science Principles class at Del Norte should have access to more collaborative coding websites. A communications website that is very useful is Discord, which allows for convenient text communication, voice communication, as well as video and screen share communication. GitHub is also a great example of Crowdsourcing, and our Del Norte Computer Science Principles class is already using it as a viable application. My final Computer Science Principles project would benefit a lot from Crowdsourcing, as Crowdsourcing offers the useful opportunities of distributed computing, attainment of data and code information, programming collaboration, and many more great advantages.
