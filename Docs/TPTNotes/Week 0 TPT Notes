### College Board Topic 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects Notes: ###

#### Video #1: ####

Learning Objective:
* IOC-1.A – Explain how an effect of a computing innovation can be both beneficial and harmful.

Essential Knowledge:
* IOC-1.A.1 – People create computing innovations.
* IOC-1.A.2 – The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations.
* IOC-1.A.3 – Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance.
* IOC-1.A.4 – A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people or even by the same person. 
* IOC-1.A.5 – Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts.

Beneficial and Harmful Effects:
* Multirotor:
  * Benefit - Deliveries, finding lost people, and aerial photography are easy.
  * Harmful - Flying in unregulated zones is illegal and dangerous; privacy concerns.
* Wii Controller:
  * Benefit - Gets people active while playing video games.
  * Harmful - Broken TVs as well as injuries.
* Dopamine is what allows us to feel pleasure and happiness. It is produced when we engage in activities that allow us to feel enjoyed, interested, passionate, and happy.

#### Video #2: ####

Learning Objective:
* IOC-1.B – Explain how a computing innovation can have an impact beyond its intended purpose.

Essential Knowledge:
* IOC-1.B.1 – Computer innovations can be used in ways that their creators had not originally intended: 
  * The World Wide Web was originally intended only for rapid and easy exchange of information within the scientific community. However, its users now include a large portion of the general population.
  * Targeted advertising is used to help businesses, but it can be misused at both individual and aggregate levels.
  * Machine learning and data mining have enabled innovation in medicine, business, and science, but information discovered in this way has also been used to discriminate against groups of individuals.
* IOC-1.B.2 – Some of the ways computing innovations can be used may have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or culture.
* IOC-1.B.3 – Responsible programmers try to consider the unintended ways their computing innovations can be used and the potential beneficial and harmful effects of these new uses.
* IOC-1.B.4 – It is not possible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be used.
* IOC-1.B.6 – Rapid sharing of a program or running a program with a large number of users can result in significant impacts beyond the intended purpose or control of the programmer.

Beneficial and Harmful Effects:
* Microtransactions:
  * "Free" Games/Apps.
  * Cosmetics/Pay-To-Win/Paywall to functionality.
* The Internet – Originally Intended For Scientists:
  * Sleep deprivation, depression, anxiety, and impulsivity.
  * Dopamine feedback loops.

GitHub Pages Actions:
1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
  * Beneficial:
    * Resources are easily accessible.
    * Increased efficiency.
    * Improved communications across long distances.
  * Harmful:
    * Some programs can have harmful effects on your computer.
    * There are some inappropriate or dangerous websites on the Internet.
    * Computing may not always have the most credible or best resources.
2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
  * Dopamine is a real hormone, as it has been scientifically thoroughly researched. I believe that working hard and as a result feeling productive allows my body to produce dopamine, which positively impacts my personal study and Academic success.

### College Board Topic 5.2 Digital Divide Notes: ###

#### Video #1: ####

Learning Objective:
* IOC-1.C – Describe issues that contribute to the digital divide.

Essential Knowledge:
* IOC-1.C.1 – Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries.
* IOC-1.C.2 – The "Digital Divide" refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic characteristics.
* IOC-1.C.3 – The Digital Divide can affect both individuals and groups.
* IOC-1.C.4 – The Digital Divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both locally and globally.
* IOC-1.C.5 – The Digital Divide is affected by the actions of individuals, organizations, and governments.

Digital Divide:
* Socioeconomic.
* Geographic.
* Demographics include, but are not isolated to:
  * Age.
  * Religion.
* Countries.
* In Some Countries:
  * Computers are not that available/common in rural areas.
  * Only a small number of websites are available.
  * The Internet is used to protect and advocate the government.
  * There is a high level of surveillance on the Internet to protect the government.

GitHub Pages Actions – Digital Empowerment:
1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
  * One empowers oneself in a digital world by choosing to use positive resources or programs in the digital world.
2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte High School.
  * A person that is empowered can start a social media page, in which they create encouraging or positive posts to help motivate those who are not as empowered. At Del Norte High School, an option I have is to start a club that helps lift up and empower those that are in need.
3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
  * From my perspective, I do not really think there is anything in my community that is blocking digital empowerment. I believe that at Del Norte, there are not very many barriers that are blocking digital empowerment, as I have noticed that there are plenty of social media pages related to Del Norte High School clubs that promote digital empowerment as well as real-life empowerment. Elsewhere in poorer communities, there may be some barriers to digital empowerment, because digital technology is not as accessible.
