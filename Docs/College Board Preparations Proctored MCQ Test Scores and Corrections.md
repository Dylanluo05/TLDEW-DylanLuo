| Question | Original Answer | Correct Answer | Reasoning |
| -------- | --------------- | -------------- | --------- |
| 4 | B | A | The correct answer is <b>A</b>, because a method to create network redundancy is to have multiple paths between any two connected devices. As a result of network redundancy, the network is able to support itself and recover from network failures, which in turn allows it to continue functioning. |
| 5 | A | B | The right solution is <b>B</b>, since the cookies created during the anonymous browsing session are deleted upon the closing of the session. Therefore, the information in the anonymous is also deleted, including the Web store shopping cart items. |
| 6 | A | C | The correct answer is <b>C</b>, because the the hexadecimal (base 16) number 56 codes for the alphabetical letter V. |
| 13 | B | C | The right solution is <b>C</b>, since although the movement patterns of the animal can be analyzed, the tracking collars attached to the wild animals cannot record the weather. |
| 23 | B | A | The correct answer is <b>A</b>, because the groups of information contained in browser cookies can be explotied by websites that a user vists to track and collect information about the specific user. |
| 38 | B | C | The right solution is <b>C</b>, since the metadata includes time and the phone numbers of the two users of a call. Thus, using information provided by the metadata, predictions can be made about future calls and a list of phone numbers called with one certain phone number can be provided. |
| 47 | A and B | A and C |The accurate responses are <b>A and C</b>. The reason for this is that if devices B and D were to fail, then information sent from device A would not be able to reach device C. Likewise, if devices D and F were to fail, then information sent from device A would not be able to reach device C. |

| 1 | B | D | The correct answer is <b>D</b>, because a parallel computing solution comprises of a parallel portion and a sequential portion. When increasing the amount of parallel computing, the overall efficiency of the solution is limited by the sequential portion. |
| 5 | C | A | The right solution is <b>A</b>, since citizen science involves scientific research being done by a variety of individuals, who although may not be scientists, should still be able to complete the amateur experiment. In this case, taking pictures around the world is an easy enough task for multipe individuals. |
| 12 | B | D | The correct answer is <b>D</b>, because crowdsourcing is the process of attaining input, data, or information from a large group of people via the Internet. Thus, a application that allows users to  view desciptions and photographs of local landmarks would likely benefit from the use of crowdsourcing as the users would be able to contribute descriptions and photographs for the local landmarks. |
| 19 | D | C | The right solution is <b>C</b>, since when the variable x is negative, the variable y is displayed as the value true. When the variable x is not negative, the variable y will be assigned the value false, which causes the display code to not execute. |
| 24 | A | C | The correct answer is <b>C</b>, because redundancy supports the implementation of alternate routes. This way, if a device or connections on the Internet does not work, data sent on the network can choose to go in a different route. |
| 25 | B | C | The right solution is <b>C</b>, since the RunRoutr application connects users to other nearby users, which can encourage users to exercise together, resulting in the improvement of health. |
| 27 | A | D | The accurate response is <b>D</b>. The reason for this is that utilizing an iterative and incremental process of program development allows programmers to identify errors more easily as components are added to a functioning program. As code groups are integrated, if the working program suddenly has an error, programmers have the ability to associate the new errors and solve them in a swift amount of time. |

| Question | Original Answer | Correct Answer | Reasoning |
| -------- | --------------- | -------------- | --------- |
| 2 | C | D | The correct answer is <b>D</b>, because there exists undecidable problems that cannot be solved by algoriths. Even if an undecidable problem has an aglorithmic solution, there is no algorithmic solution that can solve all instances of the undecidable problem. |
| 24 | C | D | The right solution is <b>D</b>, since the algorithm passes the first criteria if the time is during businesses hours, the algorithm passes the second criteria if the gate sensor is activated, and the algorithm passes the third criteria if the gate in the parking garage is not open. This will allow the algorithm to ensure that the gate is only opened for appropriate conditions. |
| 34 | D | B | The correct answer is <b>B</b>, because the factorial algorithm does not run in a reasonable time. However, a heuristic method can approximate a solution that can run in a reasonable amount of time. |
| 41 | C | D | The accurate response is <b>D</b>. The reason for this is that public key cryptography involves the encryption of a message with a recipient's public key and the decryption of the same message with the same recipient's private key. |
